# **DC MOTOR TO WORK BASED ON OBSTACLE DETECTOR AND USER COMMANDS**
OBJECTIVE:
	The main aim of this project through embedded C is to design, develop and to build an “Obstacle Detection System” for the vehicles on Road. The project mainly insists on reducing the increasing number of vehicular accidents in our highways, schools and metropolitan areas.

BENEFITS:
•	Obstacle Detection robot will sense the obstacles in the path, avoids it and resumes its normal forward running.
•	In real time, minimizing repair cost of a system, vehicle downtime, injuries avoidance through collision(prevent accidents).
•	It overcomes the visibility issues for the drivers during snow and rain.
•	It is very quick to compute the detect the object.
•	Detects object within a certain radius.
•	It has a quick response time.
•	It can also be used in dark environments.


4W’s and 1H:
Who:
	With view of sensing the obstacle detector using Ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between the two entities. It can used by people driving vehicles in terrain, roads, hill station and highways.
What:
Obstacle detection can be visualized through ultrasonic sensor, Infrared sensor, Camera, LIDAR and so on. This project has accompanied with Ultrasonic Sensor.
When:
	When an person/ object detects any foreign object or any obstacle while following the movement of car/robo.
Where:
	It can  used in terrain, roads, highways, hill station while driving. 
How:
	It can be achieved through incorporating IC(L298p-53) along with HC-SR04(Ultrasonic) sensor.

SWOT ANALYSIS:

STRENGTH:
a)	Automatic control of the functioning motor
b)	Independancy, rather than relying on user’s instruction
c)	Adaptability
d)	Can prevent faults, accidents and detect any object.
e)	Easy to construct and cheaper in cost with long durability.
f)	
WEAKNESS:
a)	May not detect all objects
b)	Can produce false reading at certain occasion
c)	Its has special physical limits (like covers only a certain range).
d)	The robot needs to stop in front of an obstacle with the view of more accurate measurements.

OPPORTUNITIES:RIGHT
	The robotic car to monitor if any obstacle is to be detected in the travelling path is to be ensured to avoid any accidents. This paves the opportunity to and develop robotics car to avoid the obstacle using certain sensor (like HC-SR04) in the pathway.
